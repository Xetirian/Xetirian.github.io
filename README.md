## Master's thesis: Transformer-Based Imitation Learning for Robot Object Manipulation
### Abstract
Despite improving software infrastructure and promising advancements in reinforcement and imitation learning, the challenges in ef√èciently automating object manipulation tasks that are simple for humans persist. Thus, in the pursuit of a broadly applicable methodology to reduce the work involved in automating individual processes with robots, I conduct a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of a state-of-the-art imitation learning method, Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT). This work focuses on ACT due to its notable sample efficiency and success rates in real-world manipulation tasks. Modifications to ACT are also explored, targeting the discovered weaknesses of the model architecture. While most show potential but have inconclusive results, the addition of causal attention to the transformer model, also included in one of the follow-up work's codebases, though not highlighted in the corresponding paper, is very beneficial. The general findings suggest that while ACT offers impressive capabilities in imitated dexterity and its sample efficiency, it requires highly uniform and precise demonstrations and struggles with longer tasks. Additionally, identifying the best-performing models necessitates extensive effort due to the inconsistency between the weights reaching the lowest training and validation losses and those with the best deployment performance. Consequently, ACT, in its current state, only partially meets the goal of reducing the overall workload for the automation of robot object manipulation, though it is a step in the right direction.

Among the experiments I made in this thesis, I iterated on the data collection process. Below are example rollouts from two datasets for the same task, *Align Push*.

#### Align Push Task Mono Dataset:
The second dataset followed a single action mode for each occurring situation combined with less initialization randomization. The achieved full task success rate was 50%:

#### Align Push Task Multimodal Dataset:
The first dataset contained more multimodal data. It featured heavier randomization and less stringently structured manipulations in demonstrations, showing multiple solutions for similar block arrangements, following the fastest available solution paths for given situations. The best checkpoint achieved a 20% full task success rate:

## Grasp Generation for Peppers in Commercial Greenhouses
I developed a point cloud to grasp generation extension for a greenhouse crop surveying and mapping robot platform, applying a state-of-the-art machine learning method for a university project.
The following screenshot displays generated grasps on filtered point cloud data of detected sweet peppers. It builds on the works of Zaenker et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03048# and Huang et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00191 :

## Multi-View Multi-Marker-based Occlusion Robust Object Pose Estimation and Impedance Control based Insertion for an Assembly Project
I developed a detect, pick, and insert pipeline for special building blocks employed with a Franka Emika robot. The detection algorithm achieved millimeter-accurate occlusion robust state estimation for the building blocks. Key skills required for the project were computer vision theory, non-linear constrained optimization, and impedance control.
These are screenshots of the estimation visualization for the project. They show the coordinate systems tracked on all surfaces of the building blocks, whether visible or not, in the given situation. Occluded coordinate system poses are calculated through optimization over the reprojection errors between visible markers and the known transformations between all coordinate systems:

## Bachelor's thesis: Continuous Locomotion Planning for an Eight-Legged Robot Using Joystick Control
### Abstract
Enabling legged robots to walk across complex terrain like staircases, construction sites or rough terrain is an active field of research with many different challenges. Manually controlling robots is desirable in many scenarios where the AI-control of the system is insufficient to solve the task at hand by itself. It is an option for commercially successful and research-wise highly relevant robot systems such as the Spot series by Boston Dynamics or the ANYmal robot by ANYmal Research. A common method to perform locomotion using legged robots in complex terrain is footstep planning, a hierarchical control archetype. Here, a suitable step sequence is planned that reaches a commanded goal pose and solves the robot control task assuming the foot placements to be fixed. An evident lack of methodology in the literature regarding manual assisted control for search-based systems such as footstep planning was noted. The contribution of this work is a new generalized approach for extending footstep planning based robot systems with joystick control for manual assisted operations in challenging terrain. It enables intuitive, reactive, and safe continuous locomotion in soft real-time. The construction of the joystick control for footstep planning based systems with these properties is thoroughly discussed. Challenges lie in integrating collision avoidance with the terrain while considering the limitations of the robots, such as the kinematics and the time constraints for continuous walking. Also addressed is how to limit the creativity of the joystick control when reinterpreting inputs for more sensible plans of motion. The developed joystick control is evaluated for the Walkerchair, an eight-legged robotic wheelchair, in realistic scenarios in simulation.

Pictured below is the simulated ascension of stairs with the assisted joystick control developed in this thesis:
